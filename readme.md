I am learning rust, i thought it is interesting language

i am learning from [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GKeHDiyM0FpNi7EBIs3tnvUk0IvRpLAWvuf4rB2OvJ4/edit?usp=sharing)

while reading book i got bored and wanted to do some hand dirty so i started [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)(highly recommend, feels like game)

and join the [community](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/)
